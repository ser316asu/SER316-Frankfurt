Notepad++ plugins are built in the form of a dynamic-link library (.DLL). In order to use the plug-in:


(1.)  Find the NppMemorandaPlugin.dll that is located under ./nppplugin/plugintemplate-3/vs.proj/Debug/NppMemorandaPlugin.dll)


(2.)  This plugin is to go under the root directory of Notepad++ installation and into the plugins folder. For example, C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\Plugins


If Notepad++ is open, close and re-open. Navigate to the Plugins menu-bar at the top and you should see it.
